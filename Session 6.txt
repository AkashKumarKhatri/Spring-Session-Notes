Framework:
----------

	--> Framework is Pre-Fabricated software components that programmer can use, share and customise inorder to simplify Application development.
	--> Framework is semi implemented application, it will provide very good environment to prepare enterprise applications as per developers convenience.
	--> Framework is the collection of tools and APIs, it will provide very good environment to prepare enterprise application in simplified manner.


Advantages of Framework:
------------------------

	--> Frameworks will provide standard template to design applications.
	--> Frameworks are providing Standard flow of execution between components.
	--> Frameworks are allowing parallel development.
	--> Frameworks are able to reduce development time.
	--> Frameworks are able to reduce development cost.
	--> Frameworks are able to improve productivity.


Types of Frameworks:
--------------------

1. Web Frameworks.
2. Application Framework.


Q) What is the difference between Web Frameworks and Application Frameworks?

Ans:
---

Web Frameworks will provide very good enviroment to prepare and execute web application only.
EX: Struts, JSF, Xwork2

Application Framework are able to provide very good enviroment to prepare and execute any type of JAVA, J2EE applications like standalone applications, 
distributed applications, database related applications......
EX: Spring Framework.



Q) What are the differences between Struts, JSF and Spring Framework?

Ans:
---

1.1) Struts and JSF are web Frameworks, Which are used to prepare only web applications.
1.2) Spring Framework is an appliation framework, it will provide very good environment to prepare the application like STANSALONE APP, WEB APP, DISTRIBUTED APP,...

2.1) Struts Framework is able to provide focus on only controller layer.
2.2) JSF Framework is able to provide focus on only View Layer.
2.3) Spring Framework is able to focus on all the layers of the enterprise application.

3.1) Struts & JSF are designed mainly on MVC and its associated design patterns.
3.2) Spring Framework's WEB MVC Module is only designed on the top of MVC design pattern.

4.1) Struts and JSF are providing the generic services like I18N, Exception Handling, Data Validations,... but Struts and JSF are not providing default support for middleware 
     services like JAAS, JNDI, JTA, Java Mail,...
4.2) Spring Framework is able to provide support for the generic services like I18N, Exception Handling, Data Validations,... and the middleware services like JAAS, JNDI, 
     JTA, Java Mail,...

5.1) Struts and JSF are not modularized Frameworks, to prepare any simple application even we have to load the complete framework.
5.2) Spring  Framework is modularized framework, to prepare any simple application it is not required to load the complete spring framework, it is sufficient to load 
     the required modules.

6.1) Struts and JSF are more API dependent, they are not following POJO/POJI kind of implementations.
6.2) Spring Framework is less API dependent, it follow POJO/POJI kind of implementations.

7.1) It is difficult to perform Debbuging and Testing over Structs and JSF applications.
7.2) It is very simple to perform debugging and testing over spring applications.

8.1) Struts and JSF are heavyweight Frameworks.
8.2) Spring Framework is light weight.

public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping, ActionForm, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) throws Exception {
	-------------------------------------------------
	-------------------------------------------------
} 

public void doLogin() {
	-------------------------------------------------
}


9.1) Struts and JSF are not providing inbuilt support for integrating the explicit applications like EJB applications, Hibernate, Ajax Applications, JDBC Applications...
9.1) Spring Framework has provided very good inbuilt support to integrate other tech applications like EJBs, JDBC, Hibernate, Structs app, JSF applications,....


10.1) To prepare view part, struts and JSF are allowing the fundamental view tech like HTML, JSP,...
10.2) Spring Framework is allowing the most advanced view teck like velocity, Freemarker,... to prepare view part.

11.1) Struts and JSF are not having Aspect Orientation.
11.2) Spring Framework is having Aspect Oriented Programing Support along with object orientation.

12.1) Struts and JSF are not having Testing Support [Developer Level Testing]
12.2) Spring Framework is proving Testing support by having Testing Module.
