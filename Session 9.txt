6. Prepare Test Application.

	1. The main intension of Test Application is activate Containers from Spring Framework and allows to create Bean objects by getting beans details from Spring configuration file 
	   and to use Bean objects in our application as per the requirement.
	
	2. There are two types of containers in Spring Framework.
	   i) BeanFactory
	  ii) ApplicationContext

		-> ApplicationContext is an interface provided by Spring Framework and one its  implemention is "ClassPathXmlApplicationContext".

	3. To create ApplicationContext container we have to use the following code.

		ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext");
	  
		a) ApplicationContext container will take name and location of the spring configuration file.
		b) ApplicationContext container will load spring configuration file to memory.
		c) ApplicationContext container will parse spring configuration file.
		d) ApplicationContext container will read bean configuration details from spring configuration file.
		e) ApplicationContext container will create bean class objects and maintain bean class objects.

	4. Get Bean object from ApplicationContext container on the basis of id.
	   public Object getBean(Spring id);
	   HelloBean hb = (HelloBean) context.getBean("helloBean");
